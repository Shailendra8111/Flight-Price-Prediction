# Flight-Price-Prediction

## OBJECTIVE 

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Thatâ€™s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. 

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a predictive model which will help the customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.

## Domain Analysis

1. In the given dataset we have the following columns Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route,	      Dep_Time,	Arrival_Time, Duration,	Total_Stops, Additional_Info and Price.
   - Airlines tells us about the different airlines in the market and their marketshares.
   - Source is the origin of the flights.
   - Route tells us what route did the flight take to fly from its source to the destination.
   - Additional info has additional services which may affec the price of the ticket.
   
2. The Aviation industry is a very volatile industry in terms of ticket pricing. The slightest of variation in any factor/feature can lead to a change in the Price of tickets. This makes things unpredictable and everchanging. 

3. The Indian Avaiation industry is a rapidly growing sector. The ministry's data shows a total of 4,56,082 passengers flew via 2,978 flights on April 30,2023 and there were a total of 5,947 flight movements. All these passengers but all these passengers belong to the upper strata of the society and still air travel is not accesible for the lower class.
## Challenges Faced 

1. We encountered numerous challenges in selecting the appropriate kernel and parameters when developing various models.
2. The process of tuning hyperparameters for the models proved to be quite challenging.
3. Converting the "Duration" column's categorical data to a numerical format posed a significant challenge due to variations in formatting across different rows, necessitating the standardization of all entries.
